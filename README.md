# Underground
Just a basic 2D platformer game made with Raylib and C++. Yes, I went to the dark side.

# Setup
Just with Makefile
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

With Ninja
```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja
ninja -C build
```

# Run it
```bash
./build/underground
```

If you use Windows, change "underground" to "underground.exe"
